<h1>Just send the prompt (seed)</h1>

<p>Have you ever recieved a personal message that was created by some generative AI gadget?</p>

<p>Actually, that should not have been a question - let me try again . . . </p>

<p>We have all recieved personal messages that were created by some generative AI gadget:</p>

<ul>
    <li>thank you notes</li>
    <li>congratulations</li>
    <li>condolensces</li>
</ul>

<p>When you can tell it's been written by software, it's not always a bad thing, but there are some factors that can make it pretty dark. Here are some factors that make the use of AI especially cringey, inefficient, rude, or downright dystopian:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You know that person well and know what they sound like -> cringey</li>
    <li>The information you are trying to convey is small from a data perspective -> inefficient</li>
    <li>The important part of the message is as a reminder of your relationship -> rude</li>
    <li>One of the goals of the message is to build or strengthen a personal relationship -> dystopian</li>
</ul>

<p>My best idea right now as an antidote for these cringey, inefficient, rude, and/or dystopian messages is that instead of coming of with a prompt, using that to generate a message, fussing around for a while with it, and then sending . . . you should just send the prompt.</p>

<p>Let's do an example - suppose that you have a friend leaving your workplace. The team is making a farewell gift, and you get a slack asking you to type in some well wishes for the person . . . they're going to print them out and make a card.</p>

<p>Maybe you genuinely like the person and are going to miss them. You used to joke about how much time you spent in the gym because you're both terribly out of shape and those stupid jokes got you both through the day.</p>

<p>Here's a <b>prompt</b> you might use:<br><br>
    Write a farewell message to my coworker.<br>
    Tell them that I'm sad they're going, but that I'm glad too.<br>
    I'm going to miss them.<br>
    Also make some jokes about how they need to keep up their gym routine.
</p>

<p><b>Repsonse from Llama 3</b>:<br><br>
    Hey [coworker's name],<br><br>
    It's with a mix of sadness and happiness that I bid you farewell. I'm sad to see you go, but I'm also glad to see you move on to new adventures. You'll be deeply missed around here, not just for your amazing work ethic, but also for your bright smile and infectious energy.<br><br>
    On a more serious note, don't forget to keep those gains going at the gym! We don't want all that hard work to go to waste. Keep lifting, keep grinding, and keep those endorphins pumping!<br><br>
    In all seriousness, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you. You've been an incredible colleague and friend. Keep in touch and let's catch up soon!<br><br>
    Wishing you all the best on your new journey,<br><br>
    [Your Name]
</p>

<p>The important question in my mind is this: "Which would you rather recieve? The prompt or the output?</p>

<p>I'd much rather recieve the prompt - it's honest, to the point, and I totally get that you're not sure exactly what to say.</p>
