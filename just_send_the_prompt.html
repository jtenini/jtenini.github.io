<p>Have you ever recieved a personal message that was created by some generative AI gadget?</p>

<p>Actually, that should not have been a question - let me try again . . . </p>

<p>We have all recieved personal messages that were created by some generative AI gadget:</p>

<ul>
    <li>thank you notes</li>
    <li>congratulations</li>
    <li>condolensces</li>
</ul>

<p>When you can tell it's been written by software, it's not always a bad thing, but there are some factors that can make it pretty dark. Here are some factors that make the use of AI especially cringey, inefficient, rude, or downright dystopian:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You know that person well and know what they sound like -> cringey</li>
    <li>The information you are trying to convey is small from a data perspective -> inefficient</li>
    <li>The important part of the message is as a reminder of your relationship -> dystopian</li>
    <li>One of the goals of the message is to build or strengthen a personal relationship -> dystopian</li>
</ul>
