<h1>Building trust in ML Systems</h1>

<p>
    As builders of AI and ML systems, much time and effort is spent in building our own trust with the technology we are developing. This can take the form of model accuracy metrics, compute efficiency, and core functionality achieved. There is another, often more daunting, step to be considered: building trust in the technology with non-technical users and other stakeholders who will be impacted by its adoption.

<p>
    In this talk, we explore four pillars of building trust in AI systems with non-technical stakeholders:
    <ol>
        <li>Describing performance relative to an interpretable and intuitive baseline.</li>
        <li>Quantifying uncertainty as part of the delivery process.</li>
        <li>Sharing the why in non-binary decision processes.</li>
        <li>Designing for 2nd order process effects.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

    After this talk, machine learning practitioners and managers will be equipped to build trust in the products they develop - enabling maximum value and impact from their work.
