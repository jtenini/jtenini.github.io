<h1>Building trust in ML Systems</h1>

<p>
    As builders of AI and ML systems, much time and effort is spent in building our own trust with the technology we are developing. This can take the form of model accuracy metrics, compute efficiency, and core functionality achieved. There is another, often more daunting, step to be considered: building trust in the technology with non-technical users and other stakeholders who will be impacted by its adoption.

<p>
    In this talk, we explore four pillars of building trust in AI systems with non-technical stakeholders:
    <ol>
        <li>Describing performance relative to an interpretable and intuitive baseline.</li>
        <li>Quantifying uncertainty as part of the delivery process.</li>
        <li>Sharing the why in non-binary decision processes.</li>
        <li>Designing for 2nd order process effects.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    After this talk, machine learning practitioners and managers will be equipped to build trust in the products they develop - enabling maximum value and impact from their work.

<h2>Why "trust"</h2>

Why is trust an essential requirement for meaningful adoption?

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>How trust works</h2>

What are the core concepts that drive our decision to trust or not trust something or someone.

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Baselines - Trust as an transitive concept</h2>

If I trust A, and A trusts B, then I trust B.

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Quantifying uncertainty - demonstrating honesty</h2>

We trust people that are honest. Being wrong isn't the issue, it's being confident and wrong that is the issue. Quantifying the uncertainty behind statements is essential to building trust, but it is usually a technically difficult afterthought for most machine learning systems.

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Showing your work - the reasons are as important as the answer</h2>

When you share your thought process, we can empathize with your conclusion and perhaps be persuaded by it. Moreover, the reasoning may itself be valuable - see the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porism">porism</a>.

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Higher order effects - we trust those who understand us</h2>

This is a murky idea - but basically the situation we're trying to avoid here is someone saying "you don't get it." This can happen in many ways, but a common one is when we fail to grasp the full scope of the process we are trying to replace.
