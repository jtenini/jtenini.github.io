<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
    I'm Joe! I have a PhD in mathematics from the University of Georgia, and I've been working in data science for about 10 years, mainly in healthcare, digital marketing, and music. I take pride in not limiting myself and doing my best to listen to all flavors of data sciences, but the historical data says that I'm most interested in:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Building data-driven products.</li>
    <li>Bandit problems</li>
    <li>Topological data analysis</li>
    <li>Recommender systems</li>
    <li>Supervised learning and forecasting</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I look like this:

<h2>Side remarks:</h2>

<p>The vibe of this website is heavily influenced by Maggie Appleton's description of <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens.</a></p> The bit I like about the "garden" cencept, is learning, reasoning, and writing in public. I think it would be good if we normalized things like:

<ul>
    <li>Saying you are confused.</li>
    <li>Admitting when you don't understand part or all of something.</li>
    <li>Trying to help someone even when you don't feel like an expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The analolgy with gardening is that when you go to a farm (or maybe you live on one!), you will see lots of plants in various stages of development. This is different than the produce section of the grocery store where everything is ready to eat.
</p>

<p>
    On this site (like Maggie's) there are things in various stages of development:
    <ul>
        <li>Seeds - the core of an idea, but not thought through. Some of these will grow into something cool and useful - but most of them will now.</li>
        <li>Growing - some thoughts and supporting work, but not finished or polished.</li>
        <li>Ripe - finished (is anything ever finished?) or otherwise pretty much done.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    If you're really hungry, there's some stuff here for you for sure, but if you're in a hurry, you're probably better off at the grocery store. Hopefully, you like to walk around, find some delicious things, but also get to see how flowers turn into strawberries.
