<h1>Quantifying uncertainty</h1>

<p>
    When developing decision making or decision support systems, we would usually like to build trust in the system - both for the developer, the end user, and those who need to approve use.
</p>

<p>
    The progression of trust usually goes like this:
    <ol>
        <li>We establish a baseline which has a certain level of trust.</li>
        <li>We demonstrate an improvement over the baseline at the level of model or process quality statistics.</li>
        <li>We demonstrate improvement over the baseline at the level of process testing.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
