<h1>8 Principles of good data science</h1>

    When I first started working as a data scientist, I would start each day by writing one of <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design">Dieter Rams’s ten principles for good design</a> down and sticking it on my desk. Taking inspiration from these (and stealing some), I’ll propose some principles of good data science:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Good data science is honest</b> — it knows its limits and does not promise to do things it cannot.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science is principled</b> — design decisions justified by “because it works” are not as good as those justified by first principles or systematic empirical comparison of approaches.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science is designed with the application in mind</b> — the goal is very rarely to create a model, it is usually to solve a problem. When we design with an application in mind we allow ourselves to be principled — guided by the eventual user.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science brings stakeholders along for the ride</b> — data science solutions exist within an ecosystem. When we fail to involve stakeholders in the design process, we ignore this ecosystem and create unintended consequences in the environment.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science is innovative</b> — our data science solutions strive to add differentiated value through differentiated data or design. We strive to avoid lazy thinking and incorporate diverse methodologies.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science is non-toxic</b> — our data science solutions consider their broader impact both internally and externally and we strive to create a world that we want to live in.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science is collaborative</b> — the best data science comes from designing with diverse perspectives. This is enabled by creating an inclusive environment where we prioritize empathy, kindness, and curiosity.</li>
    <li><b>Good data science is sustainable</b> — data science should strive to be repeatable, maintainable, and portable. The best ideas can fit on a napkin, and the best solutions can be understood, monitored, and owned by anyone. We do not strive to build ice sculptures.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Maybe you don't like some (or all!) of these principles, and hopefully you have others that you like. Whatever the case, I would recommend data scientists to think about, write down, and live by their own principles of good data science.
